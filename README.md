The map is generated via IDs of the different maps. Fields in the Hirachi of the Prefabs.
These are stored in the SQLite database in the Map1 table as a string. (See MapManager.cs for more information)

The stats of heroes, towers and enemies are also in the database.
You should only buy upgrades for the towers, enemies and heroes level automatically every 5 rounds.
(See PhaseManager.cs)

Everything else can be traced in the code!
